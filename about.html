						Hey! My name is Zubayer Rahman. I am currently studying at   class 10 in S.M. Model Govt. High School. I am a web developer and computer programmer. I started web developing from class 9 and made various kinds of websites. But, I am not a professional. I am just a student. I create websites as my hobby. Today is the age of IT. Everything is moving towards IT. So you have to learn many IT based languages. Such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, C++, C, C#, Java, Kotlin etc. So, I started learning those languages from class 9. Now, I am pretty able to write code in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, C and Bootstrap4. There is a huge content in the internet for learning these languages. In this vacation you  can learn any of these languages and keep you a step ahead in the long run of IT.
