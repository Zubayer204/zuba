		   			Top 5 things you can do in this leisure!
				</h2>
				<p class="cop">Got a very very big leisure? Wanna know what to do in this time? You are in the right place! Now we will discuss some terms what we can do in this leisure that will help us to build a good carrier. I know some of will waste this time by just chatting in the social media and some of you will just watch funny YouTube videos. Stop wasting your time! Time is so much valuable that you even can’t think! Now you can ask me,”Hey Zubayer, you are stopping us from wasting time. So what can we do sitting at home?” Calm down my friend, I am telling this now. So here are some things:</p><span id="dots">.....</span><div id="more">
				<h3>1.Learn Programming</h3>
				<p class="cop">The first thing is learning programming. This is the age of IT. This is the age of computer science. At this time, the most on demand skill is Computer Programming. What is computer programming? Computer programming is the method of communicating to the computer. In real world, we communicate through many languages. Like that, there are many languages to communicate with computers. Which language should I learn first? As a computer programmer I recommend you to learn Python. Because Python is the most beginner friendly language. If you don’t know a single topic about computers, again you can continue with Python. Python has a big community who can help you any time. There is a website named cpbook.subeen.com where you can learn python in bangle. If you are looking for some English eBook “Byte of Python” is the best. What can we do by learning programming? You won’t believe! You can work in Google! In Google, they take just a mini test, no educational qualification required!</p>
				<h3>2.Learn Web Development</h3>
				<p class="cop">This is fun one! If you are fond of designing and like math, this is only for you! What is Web Development? Web Development means creations of websites. By learning Web Development, I made this nice looking website all by myself. Can we earn through Web Development? Yes, you can! There are plenty of freelancing jobs outside there. However you can also earn when sleeping! By Web Development if you make a blog, you can give Google Adds and earn even in sleeping. There are some language you must learn for Web Developing. Such as HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, DOM (Document Object Manipulation), Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and some more! Thinking that this is so many. Trust me you don’t have to learn and memorize everything. If you are stuck in some where Google uncle is there. As my own commitment, the best website for learning Web Development is www.w3schools.com .But I suggest to have a course on Web Development. A Bengali guy named Freelancer Nasim has taken place in top ten freelancers in the world. He is giving many courses on YouTube. There are huge free courses on YouTube. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>
				<h3>3.Graphics Design</h3>
				<p class="cop">This amazing thing will like all of you. Graphics design is very popular on these days. In every part of IT, Graphics design is needed. With Graphics design, you can do from photo editing to logo creation. In these days there is a lot of freelancing jobs just for photo editing! You can get a good amount of money by photo editing! The popular software for graphics design is Adobe Photoshop cs. Start learning from today!</p>
				<h3>4.Android App Development</h3>
				<p class="cop">I know some of you are smiling and thinking that after all those rubbish talking I have come to the right topic. Yes, this is just for you if you like apps! App is the short form of Application. Android is an operating system and android app is the application which can be ran on android. In this new age of mobile phones, there is a huge demand of android apps. For app development you must learn Java, Android Studio, XML and Kotlin programming language. Yes, it is so simple. “Android Cookbook” is the best android tutorial eBook. But I prefer to get a course. Be an app developer.</p>
				<h3>5.Artificial Intellegence</h3>
				<p class="cop">Probably, at this time the most talked topic is AI (Artificial Intelligence). Man is searching peace and leisure. All these can be retrieved by AI. This black horse can do all our works just like us! This why, this is called AI. Deep Learning, Machine Learning is a part of AI. With AI you can do all your staff artificially. You must acquire the knowledge of assembly programming language. Get started from now!</p></div><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
