		<p class="para" id="p1">Education is a must. But today this very very requiring subject is getting stopped because the term "Corona Virus". The good news is everyone can quit but our S.M. Model Govt. High Schools teachers can't quit! They have managed to take classes at this breaking point of education. They have managed to keep our education alive! We show many many respects to them for their fighting from the front. We, the students of S.M. Model Govt. High School, obey to them.</p>
